# Compression with Exact Error Distribution for Federated Learning


This is the companion code to the paper   [Compression with Exact Error Distribution for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20682).


This repo contains the code for all experiments except the experiments on Distributed Discrete Gaussian (DDG) mechanism, which we directly obtained using the original source code [here](https://github.com/google-research/federated/tree/master/distributed_dp)

*  We thank Wei-Ning Chen, for providing us code of his [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01541), which was partially used in our experiments. 
*  The code for the Langevin is adapted from the code supplementary material of (Vono et al)(https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/vono22a.html)
